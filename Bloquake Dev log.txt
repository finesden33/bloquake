*added some lag optimization

>Beta 1.11 - The tutorial update
*added the tutorial. It's a massive new addition. It must be played and completed before choosing the play option in the menu as the play option is locked until you complete the tutorial. The tutorial has over 20 lessons (custom stages) teaching all the game machanics in an interactive way.
*added a text dialogue system. This code was used to incorporate the helpful guide text for the tutorial. It tells you about each game mechanic, and what you have to do to complete the lesson
*added a whole new texture: Night. This is a new theme in addition to Colour (now called normal) and Vintage.
*changed the option in settings "vintage mode - true/false" to be "theme - normal/night/vintage" so now it cycles through 3 theme choices to include the new 3rd one
*added another easter egg... but this one can only ever be done once?

*changed that achievements involving total stats (e.g. total boxes broke) will check for during a game and not just after, which would cause you to get the achievement upon starting the next game

-cleaned up some code
>Beta 1.12.3 - lag buster

-changed positioning and font size and opacity of various text
-added new font (Squarewave.ttf by jeti - a pixel font that is downloadable online, and is free for commercial use)
