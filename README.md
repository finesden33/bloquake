# Bloquake - an arcade platformer built with p5.js

- **Note:** the code is extremely dirty and shows how you shouldn't code a game in javascript. This is mainly because I coded it late 2019 to early 2020, when I was still in high school and only a couple years into my self-taught coding journey that I now look back at fondly, that is, unless I'm dealing with the code I made back then (e.g. the 1.4 update I decided to make in Fall of 2023)
- Now, I could've cleaned up the code if I really wanted to. But I'd rather do other things then clean an almost 5000 line js file that doesn't use classes (besides the ones provided by p5.js), has hundreds of global variables, has many unconventional (bad) style choices, doesn't utilize function arguments properly, and does pretty much the polar opposite of abiding by SOLID principles. And besides, it works. And it's not like I plan on adding too many updates in the future. The 1.4 update was just an out of the blue.
- So, although there are recent commits, viewer descretion is advised: the code is horrendous. Even my recent changes - I was temorarily forced to abide by my old unclean coding methods.

 - Anyway, if you want to run bloquake, you just need download this repository and have Node.js installed. Then in your terminal (location configured to the folder), enter this: Node server.js
