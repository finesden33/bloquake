# Bloquake - an arcade platformer built with p5.js

# Notice:
- The code is filthy and shows how *not* to code a game in JavaScript. This is mainly because I coded it from late 2019 to early 2020 when I was still in high school and only a couple of years into my self-taught coding journey that I now look back at fondly unless I'm dealing with the code I made back then (e.g. the 1.4 update I decided to make in Fall of 2023).
- Now, I could've cleaned up the code if I wanted to. But I'd much rather do other things than clean an almost 5000-line js file that doesn't use classes (besides the ones provided by p5.js), has hundreds of global variables, has many unconventional (bad) style choices, doesn't utilize function arguments properly, and does pretty much the polar opposite of abiding by SOLID principles. But despite all things considered, it works - and at the end of the day - for a project like this - that's what really matters. Plus, it's not like I plan on adding too many updates in the future. The 1.4 update was just an out-of-the-blue thing.
- So, although there are recent commits, viewer discretion is advised: the code is horrendous. Even with my recent changes - I was temporarily forced to abide by my old, unclean coding methods.

 - Anyway, if you want to run Bloquake locally instead of on Kongregate, simply download this repository and have Node.js installed. Then in your terminal (location configured to the folder), enter this: Node server.js
